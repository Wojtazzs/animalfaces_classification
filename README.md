# animalfaces_classification
Creating simple image classification in Python with scikitlearn
It's simple classification for university project.
It's accuracy is about 85% for dataset of 2000 images that I used.
If someone want's to extend it's functionality you can improve it in a few ways for example by adding another classification to detect faces and cuting them out to resize without the need for changing the aspect ratio.
